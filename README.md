# 10F200-PWM
This is a simple PWM generator that outputs a triangle wave to smoothly fade an LED in and out.

A video of this code in action can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWby2nStK9Q

Please note that the flicker seen in the video is imperceivable to human sight, in person the lighting appears to smoothly fade.
